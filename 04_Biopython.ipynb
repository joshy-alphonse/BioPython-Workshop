But how do you specifically handle the unique challenges of biological data – DNA, RNA, protein sequences, complex file formats like FASTA and GenBank, and interacting with online databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter **Biopython!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Biopython is a comprehensive collection of Python tools specifically designed for **computational biology and bioinformatics**. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to common biological data formats, command-line tools, and online databases, saving you immense time and effort.\n",

    "Think of Biopython as your specialized bioinformatics lab equipment – pre-built, optimized, and ready to tackle tasks like:\n",
    "* Manipulating DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.\n",
    "* Parsing complex sequence files (FASTA, GenBank, PDB, etc.).\n",
    "* Performing sequence alignments.\n",
